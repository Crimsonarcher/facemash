# Facemash
I've developed a facemash clone in python with Flask as the webserver. No database needed, the only problem is that the Elo ranking system will reset if you shut down the server.
This project is made for educational purposes, to learn Python, Flask and the ELO-rating system.

# Installation

```
1. Fork or clone this repocity
2. make a new folder 'static/images' and put your images in it
3. install flask via pip or easy_inastall
4. run facemash.py from terminal
```
The server will then run at http://127.0.0.1:80/ 


## Troubleshooting
* If the application won't run, make shure you've installed Flask, if you don't know how to do it, follow [this](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/installation/) tutorial

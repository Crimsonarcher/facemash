# Facemash
I've developed a facemash clone in python with Flask as the webserver. No database needed, the only problem is that the Elo ranking system will reset if you shut down the server.
This project is made for educational purposes, to learn Python, Flask and the ELO-rating system.

# Installation
**Simple install**

```
1. make a new folder in static/images/ and paste your images there
2. Run start.bat
3. go to http://127.0.0.1:80/
```

**Advanced install**
```
1. Fork this repocity
2. make a new folder in 'static/' and name it 'images', and put your images here
3. run facemash.py from the terminal
```
The server will then run at http://127.0.0.1:80/ 

## Troubleshooting
If the application won't run, make shure you've installed Flask, if you don't know how to do it, follow [this](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/installation/) tutorial

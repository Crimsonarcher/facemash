# Facemash
I've developed a facemash clone in python with Flask as the webserver. No database needed, the only problem is that the Elo ranking system will reset if you shut down the server.
This project is made for educational purposes, to learn Python, Flask and the ELO-rating system.

# Installation
```
1. Fork this repocity
2. add a folder called images in 'static/', then put your images in this folder
3. run facemash.py from the terminal
```
The server will then run at http://127.0.0.1:80/
